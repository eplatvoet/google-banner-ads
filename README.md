## DESCRIPTION
This repository is a collection of banner ad example sets. Each set contains 6 sizes - 160x600, 300x250, 300x600, 320x50, 728x90 & 970x250. Google Web Designer was used to get the base code, and then each set contains it's own unique quality, such as using GSAP for animation, having a section that autoscrolls using *iscroll.js*, etc.
